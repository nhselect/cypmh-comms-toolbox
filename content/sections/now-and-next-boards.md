Expand your toolbox by adding a now and next board (sometimes called 'first and then' boards) and a timetable. These are often used in school and at home to help with a child's daily routine.

They help alleviate anxiety about what's coming next. For example, they can be used in a hospital setting to provide more information about a patient's journey. [Read this guide on how to use them](https://www.leicspart.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/First-and-Then-boards-how-to.pdf).

You will need individual images relevant to your hospital area to cut up and use on your 'now and next boards', or as part of a timetable - [try this image bank](https://www.learningdisabilityservice-leeds.nhs.uk/easy-on-the-i/image-bank/). Download your own [now and next board template](https://www.hacw.nhs.uk/download.cfm?doc=docm93jijm4n2390.pdf&ver=4272) or try this [timetable template](https://www.hacw.nhs.uk/download.cfm?doc=docm93jijm4n2531.pdf&ver=4502) to use in your hospital.
