Coming to hospital can be a daunting experience for some autistic children and young people, or those with learning difficulties. A social story helps explain what is going to happen, as well as providing social cues on feelings and behaviour. 

These stories work best when specific pictures of your hospital are included within the story and are relevant to the patient journey that is likely to occur in your area of the hospital.

See this guide to creating your own social story for your hospital area. This picture story is a great example of a social story done well.

It helps you talk about the things that might go on in hospitals, alternatively this hospital book is a great example of a story with more words and symbols, and acts as good guide to follow.

Additonally, Books beyond words offer a wide range of ready-made stories and an app for your hospital tablet.
