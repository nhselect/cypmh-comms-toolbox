An important reasonable adjustment is to make sure information is accessible - this can mean providing easy read materials.

Easy read means information placed in a format with accompanying pictures and clear text, helping meet the communication needs of some autistic people or those with a learning disability. This is a particularly important reasonable adjustment for young people.

Start with a guide about attending your clinical area:
