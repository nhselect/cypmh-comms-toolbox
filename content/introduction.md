<p class="nhsuk-body-l nhsuk-u-font-weight-bold">Communication is much more than just speaking.</p>

Many autistic children or young people, or those with a learning disability, need us to adapt our communication. Communication tools such as visual supports, now and next boards, social stories and easy read materials are important reasonable adjustments that health care staff can offer to meet communication needs.

This communication toolbox provides links to free resources to download from a variety of sources including NHS trusts across the UK and access to a range of communication tools for your hospital setting.
